Introduction:
Speech recognition is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and computational linguistics that focuses on developing methodologies and technologies enabling computers to recognize and translate spoken language into text. This technology is also known as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Computer Speech Recognition, or Speech to Text (STT). It incorporates knowledge from computer science, linguistics, and computer engineering.
